# Galaxy_CNN

## Galaxy Classification

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) into different categories based on morophological features. The model is trained and evaluated using Python and TensorFlow in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Model Overview

- **Architecture:** 50 Layer ResNet CNN built with TensorFlow/Keras
- **Task:** Multi-class image classification of galaxy types
- **Dataset:** Sloan Digital Sky Survey
- **Accuracy:** Achieved ~75% validation accuracy
